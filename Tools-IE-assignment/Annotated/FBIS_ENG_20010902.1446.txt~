   [FBIS TRANSLATED TEXT]     THE INTER-MINISTERIAL MONITORING
"COMMITTEE ON THE VICTIMS OF THE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS OF 24, 25, AND"
"26 OCTOBER 2000, AND THOSE OF 4 AND 5 DECEMBER 2000, AS WELL AS THE"
"ONES OF 7 AND 8 JANUARY 2001, YESTERDAY HANDED OVER THE REPORT OF"
ITS ACTIVITIES TO THE HEAD OF STATE.
    THE BIG HALL OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IN PLATEAU ON 29
AUGUST WAS THE VENUE FOR THE HANDING OVER TO THE HEAD OF STATE OF
THE REPORT ON THE TRAGIC EVENTS THAT COTE D'IVOIRE WENT THROUGH
FROM 24 OCTOBER 2000 TO 8 JANUARY 2001. THE REPORT WAS PRESENTED BY
THE INTER-MINISTERIAL MONITORING COMMITTEE ON THE VICTIMS OF THESE
EVENTS.
"    ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE 24 TO 26 OCTOBER 2000 EVENTS LEFT"
"203 DEAD, 1,207 WOUNDED, 65 MISSING, AND 49 UNIDENTIFIED"
"BODIES.    THE 4 AND 5 DECEMBER 2000 EVENTS LEFT 85 DEAD, 330"
"WOUNDED, AND 19 UNIDENTIFIED BODIES, AND FINALLY, 15 DEATHS, 9"
"WOUNDED, AND 8 UNIDENTIFIED BODIES WERE RECORDED IN THE 7 TO 8"
"JANUARY 2001 EVENTS.    ALL THESE EVENTS, THEREFORE, CAUSED A TOTAL"
"OF 303 DEATHS, 65 MISSING, 1,546 WOUNDED, AND 76 UNIDENTIFIED"
BODIES.
"    MRS CLOTILDE OHOUOCHI, MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND NATIONAL"
"SOLIDARITY, CHAIRPERSON OF THE INTER-MINISTERIAL MONITORING"
"COMMITTEE, IN HANDING OVER THE REPORT TO THE HEAD OF STATE,   MADE"
IT A POINT TO   EXPRESS GRATITUDE AND PAYING TRIBUTE TO PROF ZEZE
BAH WHO WORKED DAY AND NIGHT TO COMPILE THE REPORT.
    RECEIVING THE REPORT IN THE PRESENCE OF HEADS OF NATIONAL
"INSTITUTIONS, SOME MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT, REPRESENTATIVES OF"
"POLITICAL PARTIES AND RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS, PRESIDENT LAURENT"
GBAGBO EXPRESSED HIS HEART-FELT COMPASSION AND REGRET CONCERNING
"THESE SAD EVENTS.    HOWEVER, HE ADVISED IVORIANS TO RELATIVIZE"
"THESE EVENTS BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO HIM, THERE HAD BEEN WORSE EVENTS"
"ELSEWHERE AROUND US.    IN THE OPINION OF THE HEAD OF STATE, WHAT"
SHOULD BE OUR CONCERN TODAY IS TO LOOK FOR WAYS AND MEANS OF
"PREVENTING THESE EVENTS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. THAT IS WHY, HE SAID,"
HE SUGGESTED THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FORUM SO THAT IVORIANS WOULD
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FRANKLY TALK TO ONE ANOTHER.    IN THE
"OPINION OF THE HEAD OF STATE, SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER IS AN"
"ESSENTIAL REMEDY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS. ACCORDING"
"TO THE HEAD OF STATE, MR SEYDOU DIARRA, CHAIRMAN OF HE FORUM, HAS"
BEEN GIVEN THE MANDATE TO TAKE EVERY INITIATIVE HE FINDS NECESSARY
FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE FORUM.
"    RESPONDING TO THOSE WHO, ACCORDING TO HIM, HAVE BEEN WONDERING"
WHY WE SHOULD ORGANIZE THE FORUM IF WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS GOING
"TO LEAD US TO, HE SAID: ""IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW"
"WHAT THE FORUM IS GOING TO LEAD US TO THAT WE SHOULD ATTEND IT,"
BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE NO SENSE TO HOLD THE FORUM IF WE ALREADY KNEW
"IN ADVANCE WHERE IT IS GOING TO LEAD US.""    IN THE OPINION OF THE"
"HEAD OF STATE, IT IS UP TO US TO BUILD TOGETHER WHAT WE WOULD LIKE"
"THE FORUM TO LEAD TO. ""IF I WERE TO DECREE WHERE THE FORUM MUST"
"LEAD US, I WOULD BE A POOR POLITICIAN, A DICTATOR.""    ACCORDING TO"
"THE HEAD OF STATE, IVORIANS WILL HAVE TO DEFINE TOGETHER, THROUGH"
"DIALOGUE, HOW THEY WANT THEIR JOURNEY TO END UP. THAT IS WHY, HE"
"SAID, ""WE ONLY INDICATED THE BEGINNING OF THE FORUM AND NOT THE"
"END."""
"    THE HEAD OF STATE, HOWEVER, GAVE HIS OPINION AS A"
"CITIZEN.    ""I THINK THAT IN A COUNTRY, IT IS NOT COMPULSORY TO"
"LOVE ONE ANOTHER, JUST AS IT IS NOT COMPULSORY TO HAVE THE SAME"
INTERESTS. THAT IS WHY THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THE HIGHEST
"LEVEL OF WHICH IS THE CONSTITUTION.""    ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT"
"GBAGBO, ""IF WE COME OUT FROM THE FORUM WITH THE FIRM CONVICTION"
THAT THE CONSTITUTION THAT WE FREELY GAVE OURSELVES WITHOUT ANY
"EXTERNAL PRESSURES SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY ALL, THEN THE FORUM WOULD"
"HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS.""    IN HIS OPINION, ""FROM THAT MOMENT, WE CAN"
"DO EVERYTHING AND SAY EVERYTHING."" BUT, ""SOMEBODY MUST HAVE THE"
WHISTLE - AND THAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY - TO GIVE
"OUT YELLOW OR RED CARD TO THOSE WHO WOULD PLAY OUTSIDE THE RULES."""
"    IN THE OPINION OF THE HEAD OF STATE, IF THE COUNTRY COMES OUT"
"OF THE FORUM WITH THIS PRINCIPLE ONLY, IT WILL GAIN A LOT.    THAT"
"IS WHY, HE ADDED, HE HAS ASKED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FORUM TO WORK"
QUIETLY AND TAKE ANY INITIATIVE HE FEELS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THE
"SUCCESS OF HIS MISSION."""
