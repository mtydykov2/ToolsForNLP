"[QINGNIAN CANKAO [YOUTH REFERENCE] REPORT: ""DURING THE DONGSHAN"
"ISLAND MILITARY EXERCISE, THE WORLD FOCUSES ITS ATTENTION ON"
"CHINA'S NUCLEAR SUBMARINES""]"
   [FBIS TRANSLATED TEXT]     THE LARGE-SCALE COMBINED MILITARY
EXERCISE OF THE THREE SERVICES OF THE PLA [PEOPLE'S LIBERATION
"ARMY], WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR MORE THAN THREE MONTHS, HAS TOO MANY"
UNEXPECTED SURPRISES FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- ORIGINALLY
WE THOUGHT THAT AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF SUCH DRILLS AS SATELLITE
"RECONNAISSANCE, ATTACKS ON AIRCRAFT CARRIERS, AND OTHER ITEMS OF"
"THE ACCEPTANCE MILITARY EXERCISE, THERE WOULD BE NO MORE DRILLS"
"MORE SPECTACULAR THAN THE ONES JUST CONCLUDED, BUT, UNEXPECTEDLY,"
THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTELY FRESH SUBJECT OF COMBINED LIVE-FIRING
DRILLS BY THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES; ORIGINALLY WE THOUGHT THAT THE
ENTIRE MILITARY EXERCISE WOULD END AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE
"ACCEPTANCE MILITARY EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND, BUT, UNEXPECTEDLY,"
THE THREE SERVICES OF THE PLA MOVED TO GUANGDONG AND THEN CONDUCTED
A MILITARY EXERCISE OF THE SAME SCALE.
    THE MILITARY EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND IS APPROACHING THE END
    WITH FUJIAN'S COASTAL AREAS AS THE CORE MILITARY EXERCISE
"REGION, THE LARGE-SCALE COMBINED MILITARY EXERCISE OF THE PLA THREE"
"SERVICES WAS APPROACHING THE END A FEW DAYS AGO. BASICALLY, PEOPLE"
"CAN SEE CLEARLY THE ENTIRE STATE OF THIS EXERCISE. ON 27 AUGUST,"
"THE HONG KONG MAN WEI PO, IN A MAJOR REPORT, DESCRIBED THIS"
"EXERCISE AS ""A LIVE-FIRING DRILL THAT IS LARGEST IN SCALE, HIGHEST"
"IN TECHNOLOGICAL CONTENT, STRETCHES WIDEST, AND HAS A VERY CLEAR"
OBJECTIVE IN THE EXERCISE HISTORY OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S
"LIBERATION ARMY."" THE UNITS PARTICIPATING IN THE EXERCISE INCLUDE"
"THE FOUR SERVICES OF THE NAVY, THE AIR FORCE, THE ARMY, AND THE"
"SECOND ARTILLERY CORPS, NUMBERING MORE THAN 100,000 TROOPS. THE"
DRILL SUBJECTS INCLUDE TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC GUIDED MISSILE
"ATTACKS, BLOCKADE AND ANTI-BLOCKADE, BEACH-SEIZING AND LANDING AND"
"COUNTER LANDING, AIR RAID AND COUNTER-AIR RAID, AIR DROPS,"
"ELECTRONIC JAMMING AND COUNTER-ELECTRONIC JAMMING, SATELLITE"
"RECONNAISSANCE AND TRACKING, ACQUISITION OF CIVILIAN VESSELS,"
"CROSS-REGION DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS, AS WELL AS ATTACKS ON AIRCRAFT"
"CARRIERS, ON STEALTH AIRCRAFT, ON CRUISE MISSILES, ON HELICOPTERS,"
"ANTI-PRECISION ATTACKS, ANTI-RECONNAISSANCE AND ANTI-MONITORING,"
"ENCIRCLEMENT WARFARE AND ATTACKING ENEMY'S SUPPORTING TROOPS,"
"SEIZING DIVERSE TARGETS, AND BATTLEFIELD MOPPING UP AND"
CONSOLIDATION.
    THE WINDING-UP MILITARY EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND EMBODIES
MORE CLEARLY THE PLA'S DISTINCT FEATURE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
MILITARY TRAINING AND OF FIGHTING A HIGH-TECH WAR. IN ADDITION TO
"SUKOI-27 AND SUKOI-30 FIGHTERS, JIAN 8II AND ""FYING LEOPARD"""
"FIGHTERS, AIRBORNE WARNING AIRCRAFT AND AIRBORNE FUELING AIRCRAFT,"
"SOVRENMENNY-CLASS DESTROYERS, KILO-CLASS SUBMARINES AND NEW NUCLEAR"
"ATTACK SUBMARINES, STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL GUIDED MISSILES, CRUISE"
"MISSILES, ADVANCED AIR-TO-AIR AND AIR-TO-GROUND MISSILES, SUNBURN"
"AND C-802 SUPERSONIC ANTI-SHIP MISSILES, S-300 GROUND-TO-AIR"
"MISSILES, AND OTHER ADVANCED WEAPONS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE"
"EXERCISE, ELECTRONIC JAMMING AND ANTI-ELECTRONIC JAMMING,"
"INFORMATION SUPREMACY AND ANTI-INFORMATION SUPREMACY, MOBILITY AND"
"ANTI-MOBILITY, RECONNAISSANCE AND ANTI-RECONNAISSANCE, LONG-RANGE"
"ATTACKS AND IMPROVING HIT PRECISION, AND OTHER SUBJECTS WERE ALSO"
INCLUDED IN THE EXERCISE. THE SPECIFIC EXPRESSIONS OF THE CURRENT
"MILITARY EXERCISE ARE: THE SPECIAL ELECTRONIC CONFRONTATION FORCE,"
"WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED NOT LONG AGO, OPERATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN"
COORDINATION WITH A MILITARY RECONNAISSANCE SATELLITE OVER THE
"TAIWAN SEA, AND COMMAND POST NETWORK EXERCISES."
    THE EMERGENCE OF NUCLEAR SUBMARINES SPRINGS A NEW SURPRISE
"    BUT, AS THE EXERCISE WAS ABOUT TO WIND UP, A NEW SURPRISE WAS"
SPRUNG BY ANOTHER MAJOR EXERCISE: THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES OF THE
PLA'S NAVY LAUNCHED JULANG [HUGE WAVE] 21-A BALLISTIC MISSILES
"SEPARATELY FROM THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, THE EAST CHINA SEA, AND THE"
"YELLOW SEA. THE MISSILES STRUCK THE TARGETS MORE THAN 5,000 KM"
"AWAY, WITH A HIT PRECISION RADIUS OF ONLY 15 METERS."
    THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IMMEDIATELY FOCUSED ITS ATTENTION
ON CHINESE SUBMARINES. THE REASON IS VERY SIMPLE. THAT IS BECAUSE
"ONLY FIVE COUNTRIES IN WORLD, THE UNITED STATES, RUSSIA, GREAT"
"BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND CHINA, POSSESS GUIDED MISSILE NUCLEAR"
"SUBMARINES AT PRESENT. MOREOVER, CHINA HAS ONLY A FEW STRATEGIC"
NUCLEAR SUBMARINES. THEY WERE MORE LIKE MYTHICAL FLOOD DRAGONS IN
"THE DEEP SEA, WHERE THEY ARE SELDOM SEEN. THE INTERNATIONAL"
COMMUNITY HAS VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF HAVING A GLIMPSE OF THEIR
ELEGANT APPEARANCE. IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE THAT THREE
CHINESE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES APPEARED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND FIRED LIVE
MISSILES DURING THE CURRENT MILITARY EXERCISE.
    DESPITE THE FACT THAT FEW PEOPLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
UNDERSTAND THE INSIDE STORY OF CHINA'S STRATEGIC NUCLEAR SUBMARINE
FORCE AND THAT THE PLA HAS NOT REVEALED THE SPECIFIC CONDITION OF
"THE THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINE THAT TOOK PART IN THE EXERCISE, CHINA"
MILITARY AFFAIRS ANALYSTS OF JANE'S DEFENSE AFFAIRS GROUP OF
BRITAIN AND EXPERTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE AFFAIRS COMMENTARY
JOURNAL OF TAIWAN VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER TO EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN AND
DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S MOST MYSTERIOUS FORCE AND THE PRESENT STATE
OF CHINA'S NUCLEAR SUBMARINES. THEY SAID: WHEN THE UNITED STATES
BEGAN TO DEVELOP GUIDED MISSILE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES IN THE MID-50'S
"OF THE LAST CENTURY, MARSHALL NIE RONGZHEN, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF"
"CHINA'S NATIONAL DEFENSE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AT THAT TIME,"
IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT NUCLEAR SUBMARINES WOULD BECOME THE
UNITED STATES' MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIC WEAPONS AND THAT ONLY
NUCLEAR SUBMARINES COULD CHECK THE UNITED STATES. MARSHALL NIE THEN
"CALLED NAVY COMMISSAR SU ZHENHUA, NAVY VICE COMMANDER LUO SHUNCHU,"

"DISCOVER A VERY MEANINGFUL PHENOMENON, NAMELY, THE TAIWAN MILITARY"
"AND MEDIA, LARGE AND SMALL, ONLY GAVE A BRIEF REPORT ON, OR TRIED"
"TO ""PLAY DOWN,"" THE PLA'S UNPRECEDENTED LARGE-SCALE MILITARY"
EXERCISE. THIS PHENOMENON FORMS A SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE PRACTICE
OF WANTONLY PLAYING UP THE PLA'S MILITARY EXERCISES OF THE PAST
YEARS.
    AT THE BEGINNING OF THE START OF THE PLA'S LARGE-SCALE MILITARY
"EXERCISE THREE MONTHS AGO, GENERAL DANG YAOMING [TANG YAO-MING],"
"CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE TAIWAN ARMED FORCES, SPREAD THE"
"NEWS, SAYING THAT IT WAS TRUE THAT THE ""COMMUNIST TROOPS"" WERE"
"PREPARING FOR AN EXERCISE, BUT THIS EXERCISE WAS A ROUTINE ONE; IT"
"WAS NOT DIRECTED AT TAIWAN, AND IT WOULD NOT BE A THREAT TO TAIWAN."
HE INDICATED THAT HE WOULD NOT DISCLOSE THE DETAILS OF THE EXERCISE
IN ORDER TO AVOID AFFECTING THE SOURCE OF NEWS. HE ALSO NOTED THAT
HE WOULD NOT ANNOUNCE THE CODE-NAME OF THE EXERCISE TO THE OUTSIDE
IN ORDER TO AVOID AFFECTING THE CHANNELS OF INTELLIGENCE AND EVEN
"THE STOCK MARKET AND THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. MOREOVER,"
"TAIWAN'S ""NATIONAL DEFENSE MINISTER"" WU SHIWEN [WU SHI-WEN] TOLD"
THE PUBLIC AFTER THE START OF THE EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND THAT
"THE LARGE-SCALE MILITARY EXERCISE OF THE ""COMMUNIST TROOPS"" ON"
DONGSHAN ISLAND WAS NOT AS LARGE A SCALE AS REPORTED BY THE OUTSIDE
WORLD.
"    AS A RESULT, TAIWAN'S MEDIA FOLLOWED THE TONE OF SPEECH OF DANG"
YAOMING AND WU SHIWEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER. ZHONGGUO SHIBAO [CHUNGKUO
"SHIHPAO] CLAIMED: ""ACCORDING TO INFORMATION FROM THE MILITARY, THE"
STRENGTH OF THE 'COMMUNIST TROOPS' TAKING PART IN THE MILITARY
"EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND IS ONLY ONE DIVISION, PLUS A REINFORCED"
"REGIMENT, THAT IS, ABOUT 20,000 PEOPLE. THE PROCEDURES OF THE"
EXERCISE ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OUR 'HAN GUANG' [HAN KUANG]
"EXERCISE."" THE DAY BEFORE THE START OF THE MILITARY EXERCISE ON"
"DONGSHAN ISLAND, JING BAO, QUOTING AN ""EXTREMELY RELIABLE SOURCE,"""
REPORTED THAT THE SCALE OF THE CURRENT PLA MILITARY EXERCISE WAS
FAR SMALLER THAN THE REAL-TROOP EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND FROM
1995 TO 1996. THE TROOPS ASSEMBLED FOR THE EXERCISE MAINLY CAME
FROM THE NANJING MILITARY REGION. NO TROOPS FROM THE JINAN MILITARY
"REGION, A SOURCE OF RESERVE TROOPS AGAINST TAIWAN, WERE DISCOVERED."
"AS FOR THE ENTIRE ""LIBERATION 1"" EXERCISE, ONLY ABOUT 10,000"
"SOLDIERS WERE MOBILIZED. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE TRUE THAT 100,000"
SOLDIERS WERE MOBILIZED AS REPORTED BY THE OUTSIDE WORLD. ZIYOU
"SHIBAO [TZUYU SHIHPAO] EVEN MORE RIDICULOUSLY REPORTED THAT, IN"
"FACT, THE EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND WAS NO DIFFERENT FROM LAST"
YEAR'S MILITARY EXERCISE HELD ON THE SAME LOCATION. THE ONLY
DIFFERENCE WAS THAT LAST YEAR'S EXERCISE WAS NOT PUBLICIZED TO THE
"OUTSIDE, BUT THIS YEAR'S EXERCISE WAS DELIBERATELY REPORTED THROUGH"
HONG KONG'S MEDIA WITH A VIEW TO INTIMIDATING TAIWAN.
"    BUT, WITH THE PLA' EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND BECOMING MORE"
"TRANSPARENT, THE PEOPLE IN TAIWAN DISCOVERED THAT REPORTS BY THE"
TAIWAN MILITARY AND THE TAIWAN MEDIA WERE VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE
"TRUTH OF THE PLA MILITARY EXERCISE. IN FACT, SUCH A BIG REPORT"
DISCREPANCY WAS NOT THE RESULT OF WRONG JUDGMENT BY THE TAIWAN
"MILITARY, BUT A ""CURFEW"" IMPOSED ON THE TAIWAN MEDIA BY THE TAIWAN"
AUTHORITIES IN ORDER TO ASSURE THE TAIWAN PEOPLE AND TO PREVENT A
FLUCTUATION IN THE STOCK MARKET. WHAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF
TAIWAN PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW IS THAT BEFORE THE PLA'S LARGE-SCALE
MILITARY EXERCISE ON DONGSHAN ISLAND WAS LAUNCHED IN AN ALL-ROUND
"WAY, NAMELY, ON 1 AUGUST, THE ""GENERAL POLITICAL WARFARE"
"DEPARTMENT"" OF THE TAIWAN MILITARY SUDDENLY INVITED VARIOUS LARGE"
"TAIWAN MEDIA TO A MEETING, AT WHICH IT ASKED THAT, HENCEFORTH, THEY"
"MUST GO THROUGH THE ""OFFICE OF THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN"" IN HANDLING"
MILITARY NEWS. THEY WERE ALSO TOLD THAT IT WAS INADVISABLE TO
REPORT ON MILITARY COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
"TAIWAN, ON ARMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROCUREMENT, ON PERSONNEL"
"COMPETITION, AND ON MILITARY SECRETS. ""CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF"""
OF THE TAIWAN MILITARY DANG YAOMING ISSUED A STRICT ORDER TO
"VARIOUS MILITARY UNITS: ""WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF AUTHORIZED"
"PERSONNEL, NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO ARBITRARILY PROVIDE INFORMATION OR"
EXPRESS PERSONAL OPINIONS TO THE OUTSIDE. ALL PERSONNEL WHO LEAK
SECRETS WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED ACCORDING TO LAW. PEOPLE WHO
INFORM ON PEOPLE WHO LEAK SECRETS WILL RECEIVE AN AWARD AS HIGH AS
"200,000 NEW TAIWAN DOLLARS."" THIS POLICY WAS EVEN INCLUDED IN THE"
"12 ADMINISTRATIVE PRIORITIES OF THE ""GENERAL STAFF DEPARTMENT"" OF"
"THE TAIWAN MILITARY. BESIDES, THE TAIWAN MILITARY EVEN ALLOWED"
INTELLIGENCE ORGANS TO MONITOR THE TELEPHONES OF HIGH-RANKING
"GENERAL, INCLUDING CLASS-TWO GENERALS, ON A LONG-TERM BASIS IN"
ORDER TO PREVENT THEM FROM DISCLOSING INFORMATION TO THE TAIWAN
"MEDIA, WHICH MAY CAUSE AN ALARM AMONG TAIWAN'S ARMED FORCES."
