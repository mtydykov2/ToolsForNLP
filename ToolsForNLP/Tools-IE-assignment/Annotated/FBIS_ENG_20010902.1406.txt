[FBIS TRANSLATED TEXT]    UKRAINE: ODESSA POLICE CHIEFS SACKED
FOLLOWING MEDIA-RELATED MURDER
   TEXT OF REPORT BY UKRAINIAN NOVYY KANAL TELEVISION ON 2
SEPTEMBER
"   [PRESENTER] IN ODESSA, THE CHIEFS OF THE LOCAL POLICE HAVE BEEN"
DISMISSED - ACCORDING TO AVAILABLE INFORMATION - FOR SERIOUS FAULTS
IN THEIR WORK. AND TODAY THE DEATH OF YET ANOTHER MEDIA PERSON HAS
BEEN REPORTED. THIS TIME IT WAS AN ODESSA TELEVISION COMPANY
CAMERAMAN. HERE IS OUR CORRESPONDENT WITH THE DETAILS:
"   [CORRESPONDENT] ACCORDING TO AVAILABLE INFORMATION, AN INTERIOR"
"MINISTRY BOARD HAS DECIDED TO DISMISS THE HEAD OF THE CITY POLICE,"
"GEN VOLODYMYR (?ZHYROKOVSKYY), AND THE HEAD OF THE INTERIOR"
"MINISTRY'S REGIONAL OFFICE, GEN IVAN HRYHORENKO, FOR SERIOUS FAULTS"
IN THEIR WORK. IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT HRYHORENKO HAS RECEIVED AN
OFFER OF A TRANSFER TO THE STATE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION TO THE
POSITION OF VICE GOVERNOR. SERIOUS PERSONNEL CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE
AT THE REGIONAL TRAFFIC POLICE AND AT OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE
REGIONAL AND CITY POLICE. THIS MIGHT JUST BE RETIREMENTS. AND
POSSIBLY BECAUSE TODAY IS SUNDAY WE WERE UNABLE TO GET AN OFFICIAL
COMMENT FROM THE ODESSA POLICE WITH REGARD TO ANOTHER SENSATIONAL
STORY THAT BROKE TODAY: THE DEATH OF THE SON OF A TELE-JOURNALIST
"WELL-KNOWN IN ODESSA - TWENTY-FOUR-YEAR-OLD OLEH, WHO WORKED AS A"
CAMERAMAN AT THE ODESSA STATE TELEVISION COMPANY.
"   ORIGINALLY, WITH A REFERENCE TO SOURCES AT THE PRYMORSKYY"
"DISTRICT POLICE STATION IN ODESSA, INFORMATION APPEARED THAT ON"
THIS SPOT NEAR HIS HOME ON (?TSEHIDSKYY) STREET HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY
SHOT WITH A PISTOL AND SUPPOSEDLY THERE WAS A VIDEO CAMERA FOUND
LYING NEXT TO HIS CORPSE. THE RELATIVES OF THE KILLED CAMERAMAN DO
NOT CONFIRM THESE CIRCUMSTANCE AND REPORTED THAT THE DEATH IS NOT
CONNECTED TO HIS PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE PARLIAMENTARY
COMMITTEE FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME AND CORRUPTION HAS
"TAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE CASE, AND THE ODESSA REGIONAL PROSECUTOR'S"
OFFICE HAS TAKEN PERSONAL CONTROL OF THE CASE.
   DURING AN EXAMINATION OF THE CAMERAMAN'S BODY BY INVESTIGATORS
"FROM THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, NO BODILY INJURIES WERE DISCOVERED."
THE CAUSE OF DEATH WILL ONLY BE REVEALED AFTER AN AUTOPSY.
"ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL INFORMATION, NARCOTICS ARE INVOLVED. IN"
THIS SITUATION IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO DECIDED TO USE THE DEATH OF THIS
"YOUNG MAN FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS, DISRUPTING ODESSA'S CITY-DAY"
CELEBRATIONS TO BOOT.
