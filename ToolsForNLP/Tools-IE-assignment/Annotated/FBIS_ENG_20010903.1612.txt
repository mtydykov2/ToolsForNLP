[FBIS REPORT]     THE TWO MAIN STORIES FROM ACEH REPORTED IN THE
3 SEPTEMBER INDONESIAN LANGUAGE INTERNET MEDIA WERE THAT PRESIDENT
MEGAWATI WAS NOW PROGRAMMED TO VISIT ACEH ON SATURDAY 8 SEPTEMBER
AND ACEH DPRD [PROVINCIAL PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVE COUNCIL] MEMBER
ZAINI SULAIMAN WAS MURDERED AT HIS HOME ON SATURDAY 1 SEPTEMBER.
    THE PRESS IS FREELY REFERRING TO ACEH NOW AS NAD [NAGGROE ACEH
DARUSSALAM] AND A REPORT ON THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROVINCE
IS AS FOLLOWS:
    PRESIDENTIAL VISIT:
    THE JAKARTA BASED ONLINE NEWS SERVICE MEDIA INDONESIA REPORTED
AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY STATE SECRETARY BAMBANG KESOWO THAT PRESIDENT
MEGAWATI WOULD NOW VISIT NANGGROE ACEH DARUSSALAM ON SATURDAY 8
"SEPTEMBER. ""THE GOVERNOR SUBMITTED THAT HE NEEDED SUFFICIENT TIME"
TO PREPARE FOR THE VISIT AND SUGGESTED THAT 8 SEPTEMBER WOULD BE A
"SUITABLE DATE,"" KESOWO TOLD THE PRESS IN PADANG, WEST SUMATRA ON"
"SUNDAY. WHEN ASKED IF THIS DATE WAS DEFINITE, KESOWO REPLIED, ""GOD"
"WILLING, 8 SEPTEMBER. BUT DEFINITELY NOT BEFORE THAT BECAUSE THE"
PRESIDENT HAS TO GIVE HER BUDGET SPEECH IN THE DPR [PEOPLE'S
"REPRESENTATIVE COUNCIL] ON 7 SEPTEMBER."""
    THE NATIONAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE DAILY JAKARTA POST ALSO CARRIED
COMMENTS BY MPR [PEOPLE'S CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY] SPEAKER AMIEN RAIS
WITH REGARD TO THE VISIT. HE STRESSED THAT THE TWO HOUR VISIT OF
FORMER PRESIDENT ABDURRAHMAN WAHID WAS FAR TOO SHORT AND A WASTE OF
TIME FOR THAT REASON. HE HOPED THAT MEGAWATI WOULD SPEND A DAY OR
TWO IN THE PROVINCE AND THE REGIONS IN PARTICULAR.
    MURDER OF ZAINI SULAIMAN:
    THE MOST EXPANSIVE REPORT ON THE MURDER OF ACEH DPRD MEMBER
ZAINI SULAIMAN WAS CARRIED IN THE MEDAN BASED DAILY WASPADA. ZAINI
SULAIMAN FROM THE PPP [UNITED DEVELOPMENT PARTY] FACTION AND
CHAIRMAN OF THE DPRD SPECIAL COMMITTEE WHICH DRAFTED THE NAD
SPECIAL AUTONOMY BILL WAS SHOT DEAD IN AN EXECUTION STYLE HIT AT
2200 LOCAL TIME ON SATURDAY NIGHT. THE MURDER WAS STILL CLOUDED IN
MYSTERY BUT REPORTS SAY THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED GUNMAN ARMED WITH A
"PISTOL APPROACHED HIS HOME AT MEUSARA AGUNG, DARUL IMARA IN BANDA"
ACEH AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR. WHEN ZAINI OPENED THE DOOR HE WAS
SHOT AT POINT BLANK RANGE AND DIED ON THE SPOT. ACCORDING TO ACEH
"BESAR POLICE CHIEF ASSISTANT SENIOR COMMISSIONER SAYED HUSAINI, TWO"
MEN APPROACHED THE HOUSE ON A MOTOR CYCLE AND ONE STOOD BY WITH THE
ENGINE RUNNING WHILE THE OTHER PULLED THE TRIGGER. SAYED HUSAINI
SAID THAT FOUR PEOPLE HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED BUT POLICE WERE NO
FURTHER FORWARD IN THE INVESTIGATION.
"    THE ITEM WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT ZAINI, ONCE A VERY OUTSPOKEN"
"COMMISSION 'A' CHAIRMAN, WAS ABDUCTED BY GAM ALONG WITH TWO OTHER"
"DPRD MEMBERS IN MID-2000. AFTER HE WAS RELEASED UNHARMED, HE BECAME"
"A SHADOW OF HIS FORMER SELF AND REMAINED SILENT. IN FACT, HE WAS"
APPOINTED CHAIRMAN OF COMMISSION 'E' IN THE DPRD BUT BECAME TO ALL
"EXTENSIVE PURPOSES INACTIVE. NATURALLY ENOUGH, SAYED HUSAINI"
POINTED THE FINGER AT GAM [FREE ACEH MOVEMENT] FOR THE MURDER BUT
"ACEH BESAR SPOKESMAN AYAH SOFYAN SAID, ""GAM HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING"
TO DO WITH THIS SHOOTING. MAYBE IT WAS ANOTHER PARTY WITH A
"PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE."""
    THE WASPADA ARTICLE ALSO REMINDED US OF THREE SIMILAR SADISTIC
"KILLINGS; THOSE OF DPR PPP FACTION MEMBER FROM ACEH T NASHRUDDIN,"
"IAIN RECTOR PROF SYAFWAN IDRIS, AND ACEH DPRD MEMBER T DJOHAN. THE"
ARTICLE ALSO REMINDED US THAT NONE OF THE ABOVE CASES HAD BEEN
SOLVED.
    AIR FORCE REINFORCEMENTS:
    THE ONLINE NEWS PORTAL KORIDOR.COM REPORTED AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY
CHIEF OF AIR STAFF AIR CHIEF MARSHALL HANAFIE ASNAN THAT HE WOULD
BE DEPLOYING THREE COMPANY SIZED UNITS OF AIR FORCE SPECIAL TROOPS
[PASKHASAU] TO ACEH ON 5 SEPTEMBER BUT SAID THAT AIR FORCE
HEADQUARTERS HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY ORDERS YET TO DEPLOY COMBAT
"AIRCRAFT TO THE PROVINCE. FROM THE LATEST INFORMATION TO HAND,"
"KORIDOR REPORTED THAT THERE WERE NOW ABOUT 20,000 TROOPS IN ACEH"
"WITH GAM FORCES NOW NUMBERING 3,500."
    MILITARY PRESERVING THE CONFLICT:
    THE NATIONAL ONLINE NEWS PORTAL TEMPO INTERAKTIF REPORTED
INTERESTING COMMENTS BY PBHI [INDONESIAN LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION]
CHAIRMAN HENDARDI ON THE CONFLICT. HE OPINED THAT A MASSIVE
MILITARY FORCE COULD EASILY QUASH GAM AND AS THE TNI HAD NOT DONE
"THAT, THEN HE COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT THE MILITARY WANTED TO KEEP"
THE CONFLICT GOING. HE STRESSED THAT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE ACEHNESE
"COMMUNITY, ONE UNCONDITIONAL PREREQUISITE FOR ANY RESOLUTION WAS"
"JUSTICE. ""THERE HAS BEEN NO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INSTIGATED AGAINST"
THE TNI [INDONESIAN ARMED FORCES] COMMANDER THROUGH THE MILITARY
AREA COMMANDER AND THE MILITARY PROVINCIAL COMMANDER FOR THEIR PAST
ACTIONS DURING THE DOM [ZONE OF MILITARY OPERATIONS] ERA.
    CHIEF OF ARMY STAFF (KASAD) TALKS TOUGH ON GAM:
"    THE MEDAN BASED DAILY ANALISA QUOTED KASAD, GENERAL ENDRIARTONO"
"SUTARTO, AS SAYING, ""EVERY PERSON MUST OBEY THE LAW. ANY ARMED"
"REBELLION, NEVER MIND ONE WHICH IS INTENT ON BREAKING AWAY AS A"
"SEPARATE STATE, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED."" KASAD WAS SPEAKING IN"
LEMBANG WHEN HE WAS ASKED FOR THE ARMY'S RESPONSE TO GAM'S
REJECTION OF OFFER TO ENTER DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO RESOLVE
"THE ACEH ISSUE. ""IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO TALK AND PERSIST IN OPTING"
"FOR VIOLENCE, THEN A PEACEFUL APPROACH CANNOT BE PURSUED. FIRM"
